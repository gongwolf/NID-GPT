## Dataset
You can download the processed dataset from [here](https://eltnmsu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/hcao_nmsu_edu/Etuw1nXMxgZAixSU405NdEkBsNo8AVsR2X41lfv1gDD4yA?e=Aec8dD).

## Pre-trained Large Language Model

You can download the original pre-trained LLM from [GPT-Neo-125m](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m/tree/main), you can find more pre-trained model from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/).

You also can download the fine-tuned LLM from our [OneDrive](https://eltnmsu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/hcao_nmsu_edu/EhTZWB27vSJLi1zSXNeQDlcBXBusi7XVo41Rjo3SC0brVQ?e=MPnxrB).

### Install be_great:
```aiignore
pip install be-great
```
Requires a `Python version >= 3.9`. If you have problem to set up environment for conda from the linux server, you can get help from [here](https://github.com/JiefeiLiu/Federated_learning_env_set_up). 

You can find the original GReaT framework from [here](https://github.com/tabularis-ai/be_great).

## Quick start
1. Download the processed [data](https://eltnmsu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/hcao_nmsu_edu/Etuw1nXMxgZAixSU405NdEkBsNo8AVsR2X41lfv1gDD4yA?e=1fG78t, and put then into the [data](https://github.com/gongwolf/NID-GPT/tree/main/data) directory. 
2. (optional) The sample [code](https://github.com/gongwolf/NID-GPT/blob/main/data_process/CICIDS2017_change_column_names1.ipynb) to replace the feature names to full explanation of the CICIDS2017 dataset.
3. Sample command to fine-tune the LLM and generate the synthetic data for CICIDS2017 dataset shows below:

```aiignore
generate_great_data.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 8 --n_samples 50000 --device cuda

```
#### Parameters:
- epochs: Total epochs to fine-tune the LLM, each epoch takes more than a month to train. 
- batch_size: A subset of the training dataset used in one iteration of training, if GPU memory is small, suggest use smaller batch size like 1 or 2. 
- n_samples: Target number of instances for the synthetic data.
- device: use cpu or GPU, default GPU: "cuda". 


### Other Parameters:

## Generated data
You can find the generated synthetic sample [data](https://eltnmsu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/hcao_nmsu_edu/EsWIEZ2UkjVEhriVpG3kvWwB80r-NyopUve1A7MaOmmGaA?e=omE0Rv) generated by CTGAN, TabDDPM and GReaT for UNSW-NB15, CICIDS2017 and CICDDoS2019.

## Fine tuned LLM models
You can download the fine-tuned LLMs by used different dataset from [here](https://eltnmsu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/hcao_nmsu_edu/EhTZWB27vSJLi1zSXNeQDlcBXBusi7XVo41Rjo3SC0brVQ?e=YXgdNb).
