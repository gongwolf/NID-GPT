# GReaT

You can find the document of the Generation of Realistic Tabular data (GReaT) from [here](https://github.com/tabularis-ai/be_great).

To replace the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), you can download and implement the model from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/).

Sample CICIDS2017 data preprocessing includes the feature name replacement: [CICIDS2017_change_column_names.ipyyb](data_process/CICIDS2017_change_column_names1.ipynb)
